        <p>
          Shay Sitri and Itai Carmel collaborated on this university course full-stack project, creating a recipes website.<br> The server-side was built using Node.js, Java script, and more. 
          while the client-side was primarily developed with Vue.js and CSS. 
          <br><br>The website's theme revolves around Harry Potter, as both developers share a profound love for the books and films. You can observe this theme in their previous work, accessible through the following link:

          <br>
